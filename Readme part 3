The intent for this code was to see which model design fits well with the data given to me on sklearn. I was given a breast cancer data by sklearn (still don't really know where that data is),
and found how that data can be interpretted through different models. The three things that I measured was accuracy which was how accurate the data presented was.
Then there was precision which showed the percent the positive data was right (True positives). Then recall which measured how well positive cases were made. 
All three models did well but random forest was the best. 

From looking up what this data could look like, I gathered that the data consisted values of 0-1 for identifying the cancer (0 being cancerous and 1 being noncancerous). 
Some key features that I searched up online that this data couldn've given me were 
Radius of the cancer cell                                                                                                                                                 
Texture of the cancer cell (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
Perimeter of the cancer cell
Area of the cancer cell
Smoothness of the cancer cell
Compactness of the cancer cell
Concavity of the cancer cell
Concave points of the cancer cell
Symmetry of the cancer cell
Fractal dimension of the cancer cell
